Team 5 Problems

1. Getting Started

We have a general understanding of what we want to do and the goals of our project, but like many others in the class, we
are honestly just not sure how to begin the actual process of building the project.  Specifically, we mean do we start with 
coding or do we start in another way?  We've tried to do research on our own and someone even asked your friend about this 
when he was our guest lecturer.  

2. Storing Locations

When we gave updates on our project to him, your friend (and I'm so sorry I can't think of his name right now) mentioned to 
our group specifically that dealing with locations can be difficult and some programs can be inaccurate.  We were honestly 
not sure how to research this, and we were hoping that you could shed some more light on this topic.


3. Creating a Virtual Map

As of right now, we're still considering using a virtual map in our project.  For inspiration,We've seen other sites with 
this feature, and have done a little research, but most of them are extremely complex.  Honestly, they are a little too 
complex for our purposes.  We were just wondering if you had any advice on how to develop one that is simple yet effective
for the purposes of our project.
