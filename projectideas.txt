News Resource Preferences in College Students

Just about all college students use online resources to keep up on news.  As journalism majors, we use 
these resources more often than others.  With this topic, what we want to know is where do students
go for their news and how often do they visit these sites?  Another aspect of this that could be worth
exploring is how long do people stay on the sites during their visits?  We could hopefully get data 
including sites	like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, BuzzFeed etc.  As of right now, we are not sure where 
we could collect this data, but we believe that it could be possible to get it.


Frequency of Particular Crimes in College Park

This topic may seem a bit conventional and overused, but we still found it to be interesting.  Also, 
we think that it is relevant because College Park is an area where crime is prevalent.  As you 
probably know, there was a situation in Montgomery Hall just this week.  What we want to know is what	
kind of crimes are most common in College Park, and what is the frequency of their occurrence?  Also, 
we could specific what crimes happen on-campus and off-campus.  We assume that this data could be 
partially found through College Park and Campus police files.  We would just have to find out how to 
obtain the information.


Employment after Graduation

Another topic that is also applicable to college students is employment following graduation.  UMD is 
known for having a high employment rate following graduation, but this can definitelyv vary by major
and department.  With this topic, what we would want to know is what departments or majors produce 
the largest percentage of employed graduates?  This data should be accessible through the individual
departments or from the school itself.  As with the crime data, we would just have to know how to get 
it.
