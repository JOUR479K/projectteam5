Project Description

Our system tackles portraying various layers of crime in College Park through presenting a series of interactive 
statistical and categorical graphics. In doing so, users are able to have an engaging experience, in which they can 
understand different relevant crime rates and statistics in a visual manner. Implementing a map assists in clearly 
representing crime hot spots in the College Park area, and giving the user an understanding of which crimes occur the 
most in which particular areas. The information presented relies on statistical data collected that ensures accurate facts 
and figures.
